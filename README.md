# Phase-1-project-LeGiT-Drivers
# Introduction
This project is a logistics company driver search app that allows companies to find and connect with vetted drivers. The app aims to provide a solution to the problem of dealing with incompetent drivers in the logistics industry. By leveraging the app, companies can search for drivers based on specific criteria, view their profiles, and make informed decisions when hiring drivers.

# Features
Driver Search: The app enables logistics companies to search for drivers based on various parameters, such as name, age, years of experience, and ratings.
Driver Profiles: Each driver has a detailed profile showcasing their name, age, years of experience, and ratings. The profiles also include buttons for companies to submit their selection or indicate their interest by liking a driver.
Selection and Like Functionality: Companies can submit their selection by clicking the "Submit" button, which changes the button text to "Submitted" and triggers an alert indicating the successful selection. The app also allows companies to show interest in a driver by clicking the "Like" button, which changes the button text to "Liked".
